  <h1>About FindMeAMovie:</h1>
  <li>Hello! My name is Dylan McGehee, and I am the creator of this project. I am 27 years old and I am from St. Louis, Missouri. I have worked in several industries in my career, including sports, finance, and real estate.</li>
  <li>I started my journey in web development in June 2023 with the Full Stack Web-Development bootcamp through Savvy Coders. I think this indsutry is a great fit for me and my qualities, and I am excited to kickstart my career with this project!</li>
  <li>I was inspired to create this database becuase my fiance and I ALWAYS struggle with finding a new movie to watch when we have some free time. I want this to be a resource for people everywhere in every movie watching scenario. With the way people consume content/movies nowadays, where to find a movie is as important as finding a movie to watch, and I want this app to be the place to solve this issue. </li>
